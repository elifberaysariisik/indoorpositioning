Positioning System Project With GPS-WiFi-INS Fusion
In this report, the analysis and synthesis of indoor positioning system by combining the
methods of GPS-WiFi-INS is made. The purpose of this report is to provide a technique to
succesfully achieve indoor positioning in the building A in Telecom Sudparis with GPS-WiFi-
INS fusion. The building A consists of 4 floors. However, the measurement is mostly made on
the third floor of the building A due to the convenience to access to the rooms. Furthermore,
additional measurement is, likewise, handled on the second floor in order to observe the
difference of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) due to the change in the floors to acquire a
technique to estimate the other two floors. 

After realizing the fact that RSS measurements are not enough to obtain the exact indoor
position, several inertial sensors which are accelometer and gyroscope are utilized to estimate the
trajectory to estimate the exact location.
